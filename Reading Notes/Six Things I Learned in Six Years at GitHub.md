- **Know what is essential**
    - what will actually fall apart without me?
    - I could prioritize what I thought would have the most impact, rather than what I felt most obligated to do. Not only did things not fall apart when I started working in this style, but they improved. I was able to do a few things really well instead of a lot of things kind-of-well.

- **Timing**
    - look at product decisions through this lens of time. Why is this important now? What else is happening in the product or with competitors that could hinder this? Are we putting too much effort into this too soon?
    - Decisions > shipping. Deciding not to do something can be a worthwhile outcome.
    - storytelling, documentation, and leaving a record of your work. People come and go from companies, but good ideas remain.

- **Run towards fear**
    - if the thought of a conversation makes me anxious, it means it is a conversation that is worth having.
